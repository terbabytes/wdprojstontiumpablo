            Eidolon is a pixel game set inside of the Edge Lab of Pisay.<br /><br />You
            play as Elijah, a ghost who recently just died inside of the Edge Lab
            and cannot leave the room. You cannot pass on to the afterlife until
            you have figured out how you died. The only catch? You have no memory
            of your death. <br /><br />Will you be able to figure out your own
            death or will you have to live the rest of eternity as a wandering inside of
            the Edge Lab?

              For gameplay/style of game I would say Omori and FNAF (????). The story of the game
              kinda has no inspiritaion. The closest I can think of is Life is
              Strange: True Colors

              It's a mystery game where you solve puzzles. With it's current pace of developement, it will take a while for myster part of the game to be released. For now, you can move the character around.

              Nope! I changed the story a little in order to manage the time for making it. This would've been a longer story (and it might be longer once I recreate it).
