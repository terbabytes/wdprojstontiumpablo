# Eidolon

### Made by: Tara Laraine S. Pablo, 9-Strontium

---

**Description:**

> Eidolon is a pixel game set inside of the Edge Lab of Pisay.<br /><br />You play as Elijah, a ghost who recently just died inside of the Edge Lab
and cannot leave the room. You cannot pass on to the afterlife until
you have figured out how you died. The only catch? You have no memory
of your death. <br/><br/> Will you be able to figure out your own
death or will you live the rest of eternity as a wandering inside of
the Edge Lab? <br>

### Update Plan
<p>The next few updates will be added in the game itself which is located in the legacy webpage. These updates include, but not limited to, addition of NPCS, custom dialogues for NPCs (dependent on the player's answer to the form), and the finalization of the tiles in the game itself. Additionally, all of the current webpages will be tweaked and finalized. I hope to make the website not as jarring for the next batches.
<br><br>
Currently, the dialogue webpage has not been created yet and is still only just a wireframe. Since the about webpage is always updated for new changes, expect to see new updates there. The webpages that have been updated since the last project update are the legacy and about webpage. The rest will still be fixed after the implementation of the dialogue. For example, the notepad webpage will be updated to add two new characters, the player themselves and another character (to be revealed soon). 
<br><br>
The current flow/schedule of the project updates are okay with me, but they can still be improved on. I hope to work more on this project for the last few weeks, and I can catch up with the rest of the groups.
