## Description

**Eidolon** is a pixel game set inside the Edge Lab of Pisay.  <br><br>
You play as Elijah, a ghost who recently died inside the Edge Lab and cannot leave the room. You cannot pass on to the afterlife until you have figured out how you died. The only catch? You have no memory of your death.  

**Will you be able to uncover the mystery of your death, or will you spend eternity wandering inside the Edge Lab?**
